# BrewDog

This was practice for me calling to an API and retrieving data. Here I am using Punk API for Brew Dog brewery out of Scotland.

Data received:
- Beer name
- Tagline
- ABV
- IBU
- First malt listed in array & amount used & in what unit
- First hop listed in array & amount used & in what unit
- Yeast
- Description

(This tableview also has dynamic cell heights)
